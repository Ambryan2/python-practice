Bball.py
    ~This is my first attempt at making the game Horse in python. My issue when starting this project is that I din't think about using loops when I first created the project. This lead to way more lines then there needed to be. Another issue is not using list or dictionaries to condense my code. Another issue was figuring out changing probability for each person for each shot 
Better_Bball.py 
    ~Second version of horse. This time I utilized loops and list. This version is better, but still could use improvements. Right now the game can only be played by two people. I believe I would have to use a class to make it be used by multiple. This would result in having to change the while loop. Even though I was able to change the probability for each shot I could of been more efficient. I could of made a function that changes probability of shot and call on that function whenever I need new probability of shot to be taken.
